# Parking Meter - OOP Case Study

A simple parking meter application built as an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) case study for the **EBAC Front-end Development Course**.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the implementation of OOP principles in JavaScript by creating a parking meter system that calculates parking time based on the amount paid and manages change when necessary.

## Learning Objectives

- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Implementation of classes, constructors, and methods
- **Encapsulation**: Data and methods organized within a class structure
- **DOM Manipulation**: Interactive user interface with real-time calculations
- **Input Validation**: Error handling and user feedback
- **Business Logic**: Real-world parking meter calculations

## Features

- **Dynamic Time Calculation**: Calculates parking time based on payment amount
- **Pricing Tiers**: Three different pricing levels with progressive rates
- **Change Management**: Returns change when payment exceeds maximum time
- **Input Validation**: Validates user input and provides helpful error messages
